# Classification
A NN is used to classify images of rocks, papers, and scissors. The libraries used were Tensorflow and Keras, including Kerastuner to automatically pick the best hyperparameters. The file without the suffix GPU includes the code used to train the network by a "traditional" approach, while the file with suffix GPU uses the CNN approach to train the network. Using the GPU vastly reduces training time for this technique.
